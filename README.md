This is a solar system simulation

we can crete new planets by pressing the 'left mouse' button (the long you press the bigger the diameter)
once you leave the button , the planet act upon the resultant forces of other planets and move accordingly

when with multiple planets, the planet 'A' is the resultant motion of all other planets force action on it


The planets are fitted with the newton law of gravitation
force = G(M1 * m2 * (r21 cap))/  ( |  r21 hat  | ^ 2)
 -- the r vector is directed towards the other planet


the velocity of planet is counted by 
velocity  = sqrt( (  G * M ) / R )
-- the R vector is directed perpendicular to the r vecotor (at 90 degree with r vector)
